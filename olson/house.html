    <p>I live in a suburb of Minnesota. I used to live in a main city, but do to an unfortunate accident I had to move back to the mothership. I like living here because it is quiet; unlike the city. The main thing there is to do around here is enjoy the outdoors. Nearby is a beautiful park with lots of nature to enjoy.</p>
