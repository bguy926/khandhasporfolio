    <h1>Brians Interests Page: Spinning Poi</h1>

    <img src="../images/spinningpoi.jpg">

    <p>A form of art I really enjoy doing is flow-art. My favorite prop to use is called poi. The picture above is me spinning them while they are on fire; they also have LED style poi. I really enjoy doing this during the summer time, outdoors near a lake, or find a spot to set up my hammock in the woods. The art of flow is really peaceful and brings alot of joy and relaxation. P.S. Don't mind the concentrated flow face. I have a couple cameras near me I am focused on not hitting. </p>
